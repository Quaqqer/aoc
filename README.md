# My solutions for Advent of Code

I have participated years 2019-2023, completing all stars from those years.

2019 was my first year, and back then I quit midway through so recently I took
it upon myself to solve it all, starting from day 1.

During my coding I've created a lot of utility functions which I store in my
util.py, the latest version is probably the year I worked on latest, right now
that is 2019.
